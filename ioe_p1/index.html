        <h3>Overview
        </h3>
        <p>Using skills learned from previous semesters the project takes a look at the umbrella term of Internet of Things. The project allowed a different view as to how we could use micro controllers as a way to communicate with the objects seen in daily life. However, these aren’t just regular everyday items, they are smart objects, objects connected to WiFi and the internet, they even have the possibility to connect to smart cities. This project took a look at how something could be created using a microcontroller, the Feather Huzzah.</p>

        <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
        <p>The ultimate goal of the project was to create or experiment using the Feather Huzzah and P5.js. The project would need to either communicate from the web to the Feather or vice versa. This interaction between web and microcontroller means there are many different kinds of interactions that could be looked at for the project. For example, using a physical button to activate a P5 sketch or using a P5 sketch to activate a physical light.</p>
        <h3>Users and Audience</h3>
        <p>The main audience for this project is for people who want to communicate with friends and family but physically cannot. Especially during a pandemic like this one where physically meeting up with friends and family isn’t possible. The prototypes created could also serve to help an audience that may have trouble just verbalizing certain emotions so a physical and digital interaction that can be conveyed to someone miles away could also help this problem.</p>
        <h3>Scope and Constraints</h3>
        <p>The main constraint of the project was materials. Due to remote learning a lot of what could be done for the project was limited. Especially when it came to needing simple materials such as buttons. Since the project cannot be completed in the maker space on campus improvising with wired buttons was necessary. However, this meant the buttons were not soldered to the wires which caused a faultier connection. Additionally, with how some buttons need to be pressed with more force than other buttons this would cause them to be accidentally disconnected. </p>

            <p1>Since the project involved working with the Feather Huzzah for the first time a lot of limitations were put into place since not a lot was known. Using in class guides to gain a basic understanding of the Feather and how it can be connected were also used for the project. </p1>

            <p1>The Mood Picker is a prototype that helps people who have trouble expressing their emotions, or just don’t have the energy to tell people why they’re in a certain mood. As someone that sometimes struggles with expressing my emotions or just feels awkward admitting to people that I'm in a bad mood, I really wished there was just a way to send my thoughts to someone so that they could understand. The mood picker is the closest to allowing someone to read your mind. Although the prototype doesn’t cover all the range of emotions possible, it does cover the basic ones, and by assigning colours to each mood the user could connect their smart LED lights to this and show the mood via colours instead.</p1>

            <p1>The Online/Offline prototype would allow people to notify friends and family if they’re available for talking or hanging out, whether it be in real life or virtually. Some people don’t have the courage to tell friends and family that they’re busy because they worry they might come off as rude or mean. Which causes people to get burnt out or lose track of time and projects. The Online/Offline allows a gentler way of telling people when you are and aren’t available for other people. </p1>

            <p1>ColPic would be used to change LED lighting systems, similar to how smart LEDs work. Using a colour dropper the user can chose what kind of light colour they would want a Neopixel to be. This was inspired by the Neopixel Cheer Lights that was found on the <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2016/05/18/feather-huzzah-neopixel-cheerlights/?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIzbDa7fvs7gIVCvSzCh3zhwaJEAAYASAAEgIpXfD_BwE">Adafruit website. </a></p1>

        <h3>Conclusion
        </h3>
        <p>A lot of what was learned from this project was similar to what was learned with the Arduino, however it also had many different elements to it that make it more interesting. Especially when using a microcontroller like the Feather that connects to WiFi. If the prototypes that were created in this project could be furthered, I’d like to explore the idea of using the Mood Picker or the Online/Offline interactions. </p>
